Udemy Course NaTours Project
#
This project is based upon my work with a Udemy Course.
#
The Name of the course is Advanced CSS & SASS: Flexbox,Grid, Animation and more!
126 Lectures, 28 hours
3 Projects:  NaTours, Trillo and Nexter.
In NaTours you will develop a Full, 1 Page Website from scratch.

And, in Nexter you will Master CSS Grid Layouts.

My Observations:
1.  Very Intense and detailed.
2.  Introduced to rarely used CSS Element Selectors.
3.  Plan on spending alot of time to complete this course.
